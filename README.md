# Mini-Excel Rust Example

## Running

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked trunk
RUSTFLAGS='--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis' trunk serve --port 8082 --release
```

Make sure that [Tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) is installed and is in the `PATH`.
I recommend using a standalone CLI version:

```sh
# macOS:
# curl -sLO https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-macos-arm64
# linux:
curl -sLO https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-linux-x64
chmod +x tailwindcss-linux-x64
mv tailwindcss-linux-x64 tailwindcss
```

## "Prod" Serving

The content of the dist/ directory generated by `trunk build`
could be served by any web server that can handle static files.
For example:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS='--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis' trunk build --release -d prod_dist
python -m http.server 8083 --directory prod_dist
```

... and you can see the app working on localhost:8083.

## Using unstable web-sys APIs

To use ustable web-sys APIs such as `Clipboard`, you'll need to do the following:

1. Add this to `Cargo.toml`:

```yaml
[build]
rustflags=["--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis"]
```

Also, don't forget to enable the specific web-sys crate features you're planning to use, e.g.:

```yaml
[dependencies]
web-sys = { version = "0.3.51", features = ["Clipboard"] }
```

2. Make sure to pass `RUSTFLAGS='--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis'` when you call trunk:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS='--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis' trunk serve --port 8082 --release
```

3. If you're using rust-analyzer, e.g. in VSCode, you should add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
"rust-analyzer.cargo.extraEnv": {
  "RUSTFLAGS": "--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis"
}
```
